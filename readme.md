###Portfolio Site with Database
- 

This site was built as my final project for ITP's Dynamic Web Development class, taught by Cassie Tarakajian. 

##Built With
- 

- Client: html5, css and javascript
- Server: javascript, node, express API 
- Server: MongoDB + MongoDB Atlas
- deployed on Heroku

The site will work in any modern browser and on mobile. 

##Inspiration 
- 
My goal was to make a simple but elegant portfolio site. I'm using a custom built API that connects a client side input (the user's astrology sign) to a database. On the click of a button, the API fetches the data, in this case, a new Hex color has been assigned to correspond to each expected input. This hex color then overrides the default background color (off white). Simple but fun!

##Next Steps
-
These are some known issues.
- In the database, there is a 13th color designated to act as a 404/unexpected input. This isn't currently working. If something unexpected is input, nothing happens. 
- The input is cap sensitive, it should work regardless of capitalization.  
- The input is also space sensitive. It will not work if there is an extra space(s) before or after the astrology input. 
- Currently, I do not have any projects loaded into pop-out windows. 
- Ideally, I'd like to change the popout window to load the content in the main window, at bottom. 
- There are some minor CSS issues I'd resolve. Currently, the button borders overlap and make the lines look unevenly thick in some areas. 

I would love to resolve these issues. 

##Thanks
